# Following properties can be used to adjust logging levels of different parts of the application
# Level can be set to any of the following (using different value will mean application will fallback
# to the default logging level, which is DEBUG):
# OFF
# ERROR
# WARN
# INFO
# DEBUG
# TRACE
# ALL

# basic root level should be WARN in production to prevent output overflowing
ROOT_LEVEL=WARN

# PA036 level defines level of custom logging introduced in PA036 course. It should be set to debug to provide
# callstack and CRUD exception logging, or lower level if logging callstack and exceptions is not desired.
PA036_LEVEL=DEBUG

# basic Spring level should be WARN in production to prevent output overflowing
SPRING_LEVEL=WARN

# basic Hibernate level should be WARN in production to prevent output overflowing
